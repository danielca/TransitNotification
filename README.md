# TransitNotification
This is my source code for my transit application

This project is still a WIP, however it's starting to take shape. A big note is that my database file is not able to be uploaded to github because of it's large file size.

The base of this application is the idea of getting a notification as the bus/train aproaches your stop. If your falling asleep, reading, stuyding, playing a game,..., whatever it may. As you get close you get a notification and you can pull the cord in time. 

In the future there will be ads (School is not cheap), as well as a favorites selection, as well as settings for things like distance from the stop, and whatever I can think of that would be nice.

I also plan to add in the calgary transit api for real time tracking. You would be able to set a notification for apx 5 min before the bus arives, and it will track the buses and notify at the right time, letting you get out the door at the right time. This is dependent on calgary transit relasing the api, and is far down the road.
